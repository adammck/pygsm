    pyGSM is a Python module which uses pySerial to provide a nifty
    interface to send and receive SMS via a GSM Modem. It was ported
    from RubyGSM, and provides (almost) all of the same features. It's
    easy to get started:

      # create a GsmModem object:
      >>> modem = pygsm.GsmModem(port="/dev/ttyUSB0")

      # harass Evan over SMS:
      # (try to do this before 11AM)
      >>> modem.send_sms(*REDACTED*, "Hey, wake up!")

      # check for incoming SMS:
      >>> print modem.next_message()
      <pygsm.IncomingMessage from *REDACTED*: "Leave me alone!">

    pyGSM is distributed via GitHub:
    http://github.com/adammck/pygsm

    Bug reports (especially for
    unsupported devices) are welcome:
